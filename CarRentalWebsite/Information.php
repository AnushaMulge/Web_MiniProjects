<h3>City</h3>
<p>The all-new Honda City 2020 has already been launched in Thailand and is expected to reach our shores soon. With the new-gen you can expect:
	Well following the footsteps of its predecessor the new 2020 Honda City feature a 1.5-litre petrol engine pushing the actual power output to 119hp. The only major update on the engine will be the BS6 update.
	We can expect the engine to come mated to either a 5-speed manual or a  CVT automatic gearbox option.
	Rumour also has the there will also be a 1.5-litre diesel unit as well capable of generating up to 100hp. However, somewhere done the line there we could see 1.5-litre petrol with mild-hybrid tech as well.


    <h2 align="center"><br><br>Hyundai<br><br></h2>

    <h3>i20</h3>
	<p>Hyundai Elite i20 is a premium hatchback which gives a mileage of up to 18.6 kmpl. This Hyundai showstopper is loaded with amazing features like power steering, power windows front, anti-lock braking system, and automatic climate control. The stylish yet spacious Hyundai Elite i20 is also equipped with keyless entry and voice control features.
	Sporting both petrol and diesel variants, the i20 houses a powerful engine capable of offering a mileage of 18.6 to 22.5 kmpl and a maximum power of 82 bhp (petrol variant) and 89 bhp (diesel variant). Besides these key specifications, the i20 boasts a host of driver-friendly features such as ABS, child safety lock, keyless entry, passenger airbags, rear parking camera and sensors, USB and Bluetooth support, central locking system, headlamp beam adjuster, and ample boot space.
	The revamped model is expected to include several other advanced driver-assistance features such as 17-inch alloy wheels, LED taillights, rear spoiler, shark fin antenna, 10.25-inch digital cluster, center touchscreen, Bose audio system with eight speakers, wireless charger, and BlueLink connectivity technology. If we talk about the Hyundai i20 car battery, every car owner is well aware that their car’s battery will not last forever. When properly maintained, the battery will live a long life, which would be 3 to 5 years for normal-functioning, genuine batteries but more often than not, premature death is common.</p>

    <h3>Venue</h3>
	<p>We drove the Hyundai Venue petrol automatic variant at the media drive recently between Assam and Meghalaya. 
	Hyundai Venue is the newest entrant in the popular sub-4-meter compact SUV segment of India where the cars like Ford EcoSport, Maruti Vitara Brezza, Tata Nexon and Mahindra XUV300 are already quite popular.
	Hyundai did not have any product in this segment to compete with these cars before the Venue was launched. With the Hyundai Venue, the brand targets to get a considerable share of sales of the compact SUV segment in India.</p>

    <h3>Creta</h3>
	<p>The Creta SX is also offered with a dual tone red and black or a white and black exterior color options. The SX dual tone variant is powered by a 1.6-liter gasoline or a diesel engine without any automatic transmission option.[25]
	For select trims, the Creta is equipped including Vehicle Stability Management (VSM), Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Hillstart Assist Control (HAC), Rear Parking Assist System, and ABS. The six airbag system provides all round protection. One for the driver, one for the front seat passenger, front and rear curtain airbags running the length of the cabin, plus front side airbags. Hyundai also claimed the vehicle is built with HIVE body structure, which signifies structural strength.</p>

    <h3>Xcent</h3>
	<p>The Hyundai Xcent sells in the compact sedan segment where the Maruti Dzire simply dominates. The recently updated Xcent comes across as a more complete sedan, due to restyled exteriors and the more powerful 1.2-litre diesel engine.
	At the front, while the headlamps remain the same, a complete change in the bumper design means the tiny upper grille disappears but the lower grille gets larger and is now adorned with chrome. The bumper design too, especially around the fog lamp area is now more aggressive. The fog lamps are new and alongside it, sit the new LED DRLs, which only come on when you shift into gear.
	At the rear, longer units that resemble the ones on the Toyota Camry replace the small tail lamps. Hyundai hasn’t stopped there, however, and has completely redesigned the rear bumper as well as the boot lid. The end result is a pleasant one with the new Xcent coming across as more presentable now, particularly from the rear. The new car gets the new 1.2-litre diesel engine too. We have sampled this diesel unit in the Grand i10 and we quite liked it. Here’s a more in-depth look at the new car.</p>


    <h2 align="center"><br><br>Kia<br><br></h2>

    <h3>Sonet</h3>
	<p>The Kia Sonet is the latest talk in the Indian automotive market. After becoming the fastest manufacturer to cross 1 lakh sales mark in India, Kia’s next stab would be at the compact SUV segment with the Sonet. The car premiered a few days back and is set to arrive in the market later this year. As the electric vehicle is soon expected to become the new norm, our in house designer SRK has rendered an electric iteration of the car. In the domestic market, the ICE Kia Sonet takes on offerings like the Hyundai Venue; and other models like the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, Tata Nexon, and Ford EcoSport. However, only one of them, the Tata Nexon has an electric iteration. Hence, the Kia Sonet EV would be the first rival for the Tata Nexon EV.
	Speaking of the powertrain options, while we do not have much to go on, Kia is most likely to equip the car with the same unit that will power the Venue EV. This means we could expect a high-voltage setup with a battery capacity in the range of 30 kWh. The driving range would be over 300 kilometres to put the Sonet EV as a direct rival to the Nexon EV.T he Kia Sonet EV can become the brand's first Electric Car in the country.</p>

    <h3>Seltos</h3>
	<p>The Kia Sonet and Seltos have been updated for 2022 with prices starting from Rs. 7.15 lakh and Rs. 10.19 lakh (ex-showroom, India) respectively. The updates bring with it changes to the equipment list including greater safety kit on lower variants along with an all-new diesel-iMT engine-gearbox combination – a first in India - on the Seltos. Both SUVs also get two new paint options for the 2022 model year – Imperial Blue and Sparkling Silver - and get revised badging across all variants. Kia says bookings for the new 2022 SUVs are open across all its dealerships and online.
	The biggest new for the Seltos is the introduction of the new diesel-iMT powertrain option with the iMT unit uptill now only paired with a petrol or turbo-petrol engine in the country. The combination is available in the mid-spec HTK+ variant and is priced at Rs. 13.99 lakh. The previously available petrol-iMT powertrain too is carried forward. Also new for 2022 is a diesel automatic HTX variant priced at Rs. 16.29 lakh.
	Moving to the equipment, Kia has added more safety kit to the lower variants of the Seltos. All variants now come 4 airbags, ESC, VSM, brake assist, hill start assist, a tyre pressure monitor and four-wheel disk brakes as standard. The HTX+ and GTX(O) trims meanwhile get the addition of curtain airbags which were previously only available on the GTX+ and X Line models. Kia has also added paddle shifters, drive modes and traction models to all automatic variants.</p>

    <h2 align="center"><br><br>Mahindra<br><br></h2>

    <h3>Bolero</h3>
	<p>Mahindra has launched the BS6 Bolero with a 1.5-litre diesel engine and three variants – B4, B6 and B6(O). The mHawk75 diesel engine that generates 75hp of power and 210Nm of torque, is mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox. The 2020 Bolero comes with a redesigned bumper, new headlamps with static bending function and fog lamps. The 2020 Bolero is priced at Rs 7.76 lakh for the base variant and goes up to Rs 8.78 lakh for top version, ex-showroom.
	The Mahindra Bolero is definitely a good car to buy. The car does lack a bit when it comes to mileage but it is the best when it comes to rough usage. The car provides a good ride not only in urban areas but even in rural areas which have edgy roads. The car has a decent amount of safety and it even has some good seats for children in the last row. When it comes to the price rang, it is a car that definitely stands out. It is one of the best-priced SUVs among all its competitors.</p>

    <h3>XUV300</h3>
	<p>The Mahindra XUV300 has 1 Diesel Engine and 1 Petrol Engine on offer. The Diesel engine is 1497 cc while the Petrol engine is 1197 cc . It is available with Manual & Automatic transmission.Depending upon the variant and fuel type the XUV300 has a mileage of 16.5 to 20.1 kmpl . The XUV300 is a 5 seater 4 cylinder car and has length of 3995mm, width of 1821mm and a wheelbase of 2600mm.</p>

    <h3>Thar</h3>
	<p>Mahindra Thar Variants: The Mahindra Thar was originally launched in three main versions of AX, AX Opt and LX. However the AX entry level model has now been dropped. Thankfully, with the diesel engine, both the AX Opt and LX can be bought with both soft top (convertible) as well as hard top roofs. For those looking at the petrol Thar, the AX opt will not offer a hard top and likewise the petrol LX convertible will only come with an automatic, not a manual. 
	Mahindra Thar Engine: The new Thar is sold with both petrol and diesel engine options. Both the fuel types also get manual and automatic transmission choices. While the diesel unit is a 2184cc motor putting out 132 ps of power and 300 Nm of torque, the petrol engine is a smaller 1997cc unit. It makes 152 PS of power and 300 Nm for the MT gearbox and 320 Nm for the AT gearbox. Both the units are good at performance and smoothness. </p>

    <h3>Marazzo</h3>
	<p>Mahindra’s latest MPV, the Marazzo, is a big step forward for the carmaker. The Marazzo is refined and comfortable, making it a great pick as an MPV to be driven in – and what's more, its light controls and easygoing engine make it easy to drive, too. It is a first-of-its kind MPV with a hybrid monocoque-ladder-frame chassis, a transversely mounted engine and power transmitted to the front wheels. Overall, the Marazzo is a sophisticated package with the potential to attract both Maruti Suzuki Ertiga and Toyota Innova Crysta buyers.
	The Marazzo is powered by a 123hp, 1.5-litre diesel engine coupled with a 6-speed manual transmission. There’s also an Eco mode for those looking to maximize efficiency. In our efficiency tests, it actually performed better than both, the Toyota Innova and Tata Hexa. However, when it comes to performance, the latter two with their more powerful and larger engine have an advantage.</p>

    <h2 align="center"><br><br>Maruthi Suzuki<br><br></h2>

    <h3>Dzire</h3>
	<p>The Maruti Swift Dzire has been an immense success since its launch in 2008. Maruti engineered a boot onto the already popular Swift hatchback to manufacture this saloon that sold over 300,000 cars within four years. The Dzire looks smart with a curvaceous bonnet, powerful swift car battery, and bold body lines. The profile looks graceful with a fluid-like quality running from front to back too. Also, the rear is styled with wraparound tail lights that blend well with the bumpers. Without any doubt, the Maruti Dzire looks robust and has tonnes of boot space enhancing its versatility. This car is offered in diesel as well as petrol variants with a 5-speed manual gearbox.
	Both petrol and diesel variants of the Maruti Dzire come with a 1.2-liter, 4-cylinder engine. The petrol variant produces a bhp of 85.80, whereas the diesel variant has a maximum bhp of 73.9. Dzire’s cabin includes a wealth of features like automatic climate control, air quality control, adjustable steering console, height-adjustable seats, fabric upholstery, airbags, brake assist, ABS, crash sensor, child safety locks, entertainment unit, and much more!</p>

    <h3>Celerio</h3>

	<p>The Maruti Suzuki Celerio's neutral design language continues on the diesel version with the large headlamp cluster, strong lines and a tallboy stance. There are new DDiS badges though on the front fenders and boot-lid. 
	The interiors have been carried over as well, finished in a black and beige colour scheme with faux dark wood/silver inserts. The large windows lend an airy feel to the cabin and the Swift derived steering wheel offers a more upmarket appearance. The hard plastics are a bit of let down. 
	The audio system comes with a host of connectivity options including Bluetooth, USB and AUX, while the instrument cluster is clear and easy to ready. There is ample legroom at the front and rear seats that provide adequate support and the ergonomics are just right on the car.  
	Power on the Celerio diesel comes from a newly developed 793cc twin-cylinder turbocharged engine that belts out 47.6 PS at 3500 RPM and 125 Nm of torque at 2000 RPM. Weighing just 89 kgs, the all-aluminium engine comes with a lot of clatter on the outside, but the NVH levels inside the cabin are pleasingly good. 
The hydraulic clutch is light on the Celerio diesel and the 5-speed gearbox is smooth and changes gears seamlessly. You do feel a bit of turbo lag present initially, but the motor gains momentum quickly courtesy of early upshifts.  
	The two-cylinder motor is a peppy unit and is great for cruising in the city; whereas a short turning radius of 4.7 metres makes the car quite practical. Highway performance though isn't one of its strong points and the engine does take efforts to climb beyond the 100 km/hr mark. </p>

    <h3>S-Presso</h3>
	<p>Maruti S-Presso, the spiritual successor to the Maruti Alto, has started testing in public with heavy camouflage. The all-new hatchback which squarely targets the Renault Kwid is widely expected to be a make a great impact in the Indian small car segment which has been shrinking gradually. The S-Presso is essentially the production version of the Future-S Concept which was showcased at the previous edition of Auto Expo. It is not surprising that Maruti opted for a crossover-ish styling for its new small car given how well the Indian audience received the Renault Kwid. Here is a speculative rendering of the Maruti S-Presso created by our design specialist Pratyush Rout. The rendering uses the design elements of Future-S and shape of the test mule as references. So, it is reasonably close to the real deal although finer elements such as shape of headlamps and grille may vary.</p>

    <h3>Ignis</h3>
	<p>Maruti Suzuki has launched the 2020 Ignis facelift in India with prices starting from Rs 4.89 lakh. We were under the impression that Maruti would launch the updated hatchback at Auto Expo 2020.
	The changes to the exterior are minimal. So, you get new front and rear bumpers with silver accents and a novel grille, which we are not huge fans of. Apart from that, cosmetically, the Ignis remains the same but there are two new colours: Turquoise Blue and Lucent Orange. Apart from this, the Ignis is also avaialbe with a dual-tone paint option for Zeta and Alpha variants priced Rs 13,000 more.</p>


    <h2 align="center"><br><br>Toyota<br><br></h2>

    <h3>vios</h3>
	<p>As far as the specification is concerned, the Indian-spec Vios will be similar to the ASEAN-spec launched in Thailand and Singapore. It will measure 4,425mm in length, 1,730mm in width and 1,475mm in height with a wheelbase of 2,550mm and a 133mm ground clearance. Powering it will be the 1.5-litre VVT-i petrol engine that produces 105bhp and 140Nm of torque. The oil burner could be the 1.4-litre D-4D diesel engine that develops 87bhp and 205Nm which also does its duty in the Corolla Altis. Toyota might offer the five-speed manual as standard with the option of CVT as well.
	The Vios is a handsome looking sedan finished with the same design language as the modern Toyotas like the Prius and the Camry. It carries sleek LED headlights with DRL and similarly designed tail lights, stylish 16-inch alloy wheels, large gaping grille with air vents and subtle overall styling. On the inside, expect all the features that can be offered in this segment like a touchscreen infotainment system, climate control, sunroof, rear AC vents, and dual-tone cabin. The Toyota also boasts of the best-in-class cabin space which could give it an instant upper hand over its direct rivals.</p>
